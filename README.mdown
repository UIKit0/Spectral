Spectral
=============

Give the iOS lockscreen a little more character with blurred album artwork!

## How do I compile?
I used Theos for this. You'll need to install them and setup the appropriate environment variables etc as well as configuring. Info on that [here](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started).

ARM64 support is enabled by default and if you need help setting that up check [here](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Updating_extensions_for_iOS_7).

If you edit the Makefile you can specify your iOS device's ip and such to build and run using `make package install`. Otherwise you can simply `make package` to generate a .deb file and install that by any means.

## Price?
Totally free! If you'd like to support my continuation of this project (and others!), feel free to [donate](http://www.adambell.ca/donate/)! It'd be much appreciated :D

## License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
